# TWO PLAYER TIC-TAC-TOE GAME

# Project Objective:
This C language project aims to develop a TIC-TAC-TOE game with better User Interface.
This is a multiplayer game anybody can use to play with their friends.

# Project Description:
This TIC-TAC-TOE game is designed for two players (both supposedly humans). In this game, there is a board with 3x3 squares. The two players take turns putting their marks on a 3x3 game board. The goal of TIC-TAC-TOE game is that one of the players to get 3 same symbols in a row - horizontally, vertically or diagonally on a 3X3 grid. The player who first gets 3 of his/her symbols in a row - vertically, horizontally, or diagonally wins the game, and other loses the game. If both of them will fail to do so the game ends up in tie.

# Game Rules:
1. This game is played on a grid that is 3 squares by 3 squares.
2. You are X, your friend is O (or vice versa).                    
3. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.        
4. First player to get 3 marks in a row (up, down, diagonally) is the winner.                                                  
5. When all the 9 squares will be filled, game will be over.
6. In case no players has 3 marks in a row, the game ends on a tie.
